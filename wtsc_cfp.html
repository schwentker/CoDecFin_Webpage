	<h2>6<sup>th</sup> Workshop on Trusted Smart Contracts</h2>
	<h4>
	  In Association with Financial Cryptography 2022<br><br>
	  February 18, 2022<br><br>
	  <!--a href="https://www.radissonhotels.com/en-us/hotels/radisson-resort-grenada-beach/" target="_blank">Radisson Grenada Beach Resort</a--><br>
	</h4>
	      

	  <h2>Call for Papers</h2>
		
	  <p>
	 
	 
Decentralised computing and smart contracts are emerging as the framework for applications ranging from cryptocurrencies, to decentralised finance, provenance, self-sovereign identity, non-fungible tokens, to cite but a few. <i> Smart contracts </i>, i.e. self-enforcing agreements in the form of executable programs are deployed to and run on top of (specialised) blockchains. Present in Bitcoin, mainstream within Ethereum and pervasive in all the last-generation blockchain and multi-chain proposals, smart contract languages and technologies are undergoing an interesting and challenging evolution, which poses open research questions.
<!--
	  A prominent example, also in terms of capitalisation and
	  market share, is the Ethereum blockchain.  It has a
	  Turing-complete programming model, and bears one of the most
	  strikingly performed attacks, the DAO attack (not to mention
	  the discussed fork adopted as a counter measure). Possible
	  further directions, are drawn by in-progress proposals like
	  Tezos, where algorithmic validation also embraces
	  decentralised consensus:
	  <i>smart contracts can negotiate the rules themselves which enable
	  decentralised trust.</i>
	  </p>
-->

	   </p>
	    <p>
	 
Such a novel and evolving programming framework and execution environment is challenging in terms of definition and verification. Multidisciplinary and multifactorial aspects affect correctness, safety, efficiency, resilience, privacy, accountability, regulatory compliance, and trust in smart contracts. This workshop focuses on various aspects of the new engineering paradigms, research on programming languages and verification methodologies, in broad terms, for the foundations of <i>Trusted Smart Contracts.</i>
	    </p>
	     <p>
	 
	 
A non-exhaustive list of topics of interest and open problems includes: 
	  </p>
 	  
- validation and definition of the programming abstractions and execution models,
	  <br>

- foundations of software engineering for smart contracts,
	  <br>

- authentication and anonymity management,
	  <br>

- privacy and privacy-preserving contracts,
	  <br>

- oblivious transfer,
	  <br>

- data provenance,
	  <br>

- access rights,
	  <br>

- game-theoretic approaches for security and validation,
	  <br>

- resilience of the validation/mining/execution model,
	  <br>

- verification of the properties expected to be enforced by smart contracts,
	  <br>

- fairness and decentralisation of contracts and their management,
	  <br>

- effects of consensus mechanisms and proof-of mechanisms on smart contracts,
	  <br>

- smart contract in side-chains and multi-chains,
	  <br>

- blockchain data analytics,
	  <br>

- law and regulatory aspects,
	  <br>

- rewards, economics and sustainability/stability of the framework,
	  <br>

- comparison of the permissioned and non-permissioned scenarios,
	  <br>

- use cases and killer applications of smart contracts.

	  <br>


	     <p>
	 
	 
A non-exhaustive list of applications includes: 
	  </p>

- decentralised finance,
<br>

- self-sovereign identity,
<br>

- non-fungible tokens, 
<br>

- central bank digital currencies,
<br>

- programmable money, 
<br>

- future outlook on smart contract technologies. 
<br>



<p>
The WTSC workshop aims to gather together researchers from both academia and industry interested in the many facets of Trusted Smart Contract engineering, and to provide a multi-disciplinary forum for discussing open problems, proposed solutions and the vision on future developments. WTSC focuses primarily on smart contracts as an application layer on top of blockchains. Aspects of the underlying supporting blockchains may clearly become relevant in so much as they affect properties of the smart contracts. 
</p>


	  <p>
	  Experts in fields including (a non-exhaustive list):
	  </p>
	  - programming languages,
	  <br>
	  - verification,
	  <br>
	  - security,
	  <br>
	  - software engineering,
	  <br>
          - decision and game theory,
	  <br>
          - cryptography,
	  <br>
          - finance and economics,
	  <br>
	  -  law and regulators,
	  <br>
	  <br>
	 as well as, practitioners and relevant companies, are invited to take part and submit their findings, case studies and reports on open problems for presentation at the workshop.  <br> <br>

	      <p> WTSC adopts a submission schedule with <font color="#FF0000"> double deadline </font>. A first deadline will allow authors to plan their participation well in advance. A second deadline will allow authors who need extra time to develop their contributions, to have a further opportunity to participate. Selected borderline papers from the first deadline will be considered for and also invited to resubmit to the second deadline.

	      </p>
	  <p>
	    Abstract registration is kindly requested in advance for both deadlines.
